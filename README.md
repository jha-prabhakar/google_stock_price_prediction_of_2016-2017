# Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The RNN is built using the Keras library.


## Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that involves analyzing historical data and utilizing machine learning techniques. This project showcases the implementation of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for stock price prediction using the Keras library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- keras

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn keras
Download the necessary CSV files:

Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv: Historical training stock price data.
Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv: Historical testing stock price data.
Place the downloaded CSV files in the same directory as the script.
